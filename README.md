# Ticking Clock

Ticking Clock is a super simple, single index.html clock app

- See what time it is
- Set an alarm

# Get up and running!

This app ships with a standalone babel build via CDN, so no build step!
There are no steps to follow or npm packages to download.
All libraries are served via CDN using link or script tags.

Download folder (clone repo) with assets (must have assets and css) and run the index.html
in your favorite browser

### Tech

Ticking Clock uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - My favorite UI library, it is very good at handling frequent UI updates (such as every second)
- [Babel (standalone build)] - I chose to use a buildless index.html to make sharing easy and avoid requiring a server/buildstep.
- [FontAwesome] - Icons of course.
- [Google Font] - For a single font stylesheet
- [Normalize.css] - habitual, but helpful
